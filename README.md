This application utilized two API's one for location and another for weather. So the user should be able to type in a location and get the current weather along with the weather for the next few days along with some other information. THe application utilizes React and the two API's. I decided to go with a weather application because simply I'm constantly looking at the weather my kids and I aren't putting on too few or too many layers.
